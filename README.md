# Sine Wave Generation with DAC on Agafia SG0 Board
Generate Sine Wave using DAC 

This project demonstrates how to generate a sine wave using the DAC peripheral on the Agafia SG0 (STM32G0 series) board. The code is written in C and uses STM32 HAL libraries, making it easy to adapt for similar STM32 microcontrollers.

## Features

- Generates a smooth sine wave using the DAC.
- Reads analog input via ADC and dynamically adjusts the sine wave frequency.
- UART output for debugging and monitoring ADC values.
- LED status indication and timer-based events.

## Hardware Requirements

- Agafia SG0 board (STM32G0 series)
- USB cable for programming and UART
- (Optional) Oscilloscope to visualize the DAC output
- Potentiometer for ADC
